## Project-Description

it's a landing page with starter code with CSS , HTML and a file of javascript that i worked on it to do the specific instructions.
The main idea it's is a page with multipe sections that need to add a dyanmically navigation bar contains items with the names of the existing sections and when clicking at any item of them it should scroll to the corresponding section and whenever a section in the viewport we should distinguish it from other sections by add active class to it ,we also should take care of the performance of the code and the usability and write a good comments to explain what i made.
